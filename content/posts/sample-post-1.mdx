# The Whispering Forest

Deep within the ancient forest, where sunlight filters through emerald canopies, lies a secret only the wind knows. The locals speak of spirits that dance between the trees at dusk, their laughter carried by the evening breeze.

Hana had heard these stories since childhood, tales told by her grandmother as they sat by the hearth on winter nights. But at seventeen, with the weight of adulthood approaching, such fancies seemed distant memories.

Until the day she followed the whispers...
